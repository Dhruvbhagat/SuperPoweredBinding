 @brief Opens a file for decoding.

 @param offset Byte offset in the file.

 @param stemsIndex Stems track index for Native Instruments Stems format.
 @param customHTTPHeaders NULL terminated list of custom headers for http communication.

In this case, iterate over open() until it returns something else than "@". It's recommended to sleep 50-100 ms in every iteration to allow the network stack doing its job without blowing up the CPU.
